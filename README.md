# DOTFILES

Configuration files as well as installation scrip for dependencies.

## Installation

To install the dotfiles and all the dependencies run the following commands:

```bash
DOTFILES_DIR="$HOME/.config/dotfiles"
git clone https://gitlab.com/mrswats/dotfiles.git $DOTFILES_DIR
cd $DOTFILES_DIR
```

TODO: Create a setup script
The TL;DR; is that you should link the appropriate files into the appropriate locations.
